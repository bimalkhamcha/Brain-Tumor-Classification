    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    
    <p>
        Brain Tumor is the uncontrolled growths of extra cellular mass of tissue. Brain tumors are very common and aggressive disease,
        leading to very disability or very short life expectancy. It is very important that it needs to be detected as early as possible 
        for proper treatment since it may be deadly and cannot be cured if itâ€™s too late. Affected people may not notice any symptoms at first, 
        but if the cancer cells grow too big, it starts to show negative impacts on the body. Neurologists and radiologists need to perform many 
        tests to diagnose this threatening disease. It requires a lot of time and expenses, and there is a human error factor as well in classifying 
        the wrong tumor. So for detecting brain tumor, we have to build a model to lessen the time and cost. In this paper, we have proposed a 
        Convolution Neural Network (CNN) system for early detection of brain tumor. The system is trained using the preprocessed MRI images, 
        and when new input images are given to the system, it classifies glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or no tumor based on the features extracted during training.
