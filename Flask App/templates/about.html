    <h1>About Brain Tumor Classification</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Brain Tumor Classification project, where we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
        to classify and diagnose brain tumors from medical images. The goal of this project is to assist in the
        early detection and classification of brain tumors, providing valuable insights for medical professionals.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        Our CNN model is trained on a dataset of brain images, learning to distinguish between different types
        of tumors. The model leverages the power of deep learning to extract meaningful features from the images,
        enabling accurate classification.
    </p>

    <h2>Contributors</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a collaborative effort, and we would like to acknowledge the contributions of our team members:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Bimal Khamcha</li>
        <li>Sher Bahadur Gaha</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        They have worked diligently to develop and improve the brain tumor classification model. Their dedication
        and expertise have been instrumental in the success of this project.
